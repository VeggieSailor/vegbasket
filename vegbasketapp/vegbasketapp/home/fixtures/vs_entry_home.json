Long ago, the land was home to the Yuchi Indians, a peace loving, gentle, agrarian tribe.  The Yuchi Indians have moved on but the pine forests, the rolling hills, and the quiet remain. </p>\n<p>Uchee Pines was founded in 1970 by Doctors Agatha and Calvin Thrash to emphasize prevention and cure of disease through natural means. God had given these doctors of pathology and internal medicine, a vision of demonstrating the true power of healing from the Great Physician through simple natural remedies.</p>\n<p>Their knowledge of the devastation caused by disease provided a powerful incentive for the establishment of a retreat in the country surrounded by flowers and trees, orchards and vegetables, where all the advantages of God's remedies could be obtained.</p>\n<p>The highly trained staff of physicians, trained in conventional medicine and complementary natural healing, assisted by Lifestyle Counselors, treats guests using lifestyle modification techniques, simple remedies, and various healing treatments such as therapeutic massage and hydrotherapy, including the use of heated whirlpool, fomentations, and Russian steam bath. </p>\n<p>The Center's live-in program consists of two levels and has been successful in dramatically impacting those with such disorders as diabetes, heart disease, high blood pressure, and even cancer. The first level is geared toward those who are experiencing serious health problems and are in need of individualized treatment. The second level is for individuals, who would like to experience a lifestyle change, improve their health and learn simple methods of preventing and treating disease.</p>\n<p>While at the Lifestyle Center, individuals will enjoy healthy and delicious vegan meals in our new Lifestyle Center dining facility and benefit from an extensive program of health education and preventive medicine orientation. Health lectures are given to the guests five days a week. We also offer demonstrations in healthful cooking as well as personal instruction and counseling in such areas as smoking cessation and the harmful effects of drugs</p>\n<p>The Center has six semiprivate rooms (each with two twin-sized beds) and 14 private rooms (with queen-sized beds). All of the beds are Select Comfort. Each room has its own private bathroom.</p>\n<p>Uchee Pines Institute is located in east central Alabama about 15 miles from Columbus Georgia, near the small community of Fort Mitchell, Alabama.</p>\n", "slug": "uchee-pines-institute-lifestyle-wellness-cen-8", "created": "2015-12-20T18:21:55.021Z", "categories": [3, 7], "results_geo_place": "", "content_type": 8, "name": "Uchee Pines Institute-Lifestyle Wellness Center", "allows_reservations": true, "payments": [1, 2, 4, 5], "price": 2, "address1": "30 Uchee Pines Rd.", "region": 19, "rating_count": 1, "short_description": "The Lifestyle Center at Uchee Pines is a \"wholistic\" healthcare facility with a relaxed and professional atmosphere, providing peace of mind, spiritual renewal and physical restoration.", "level": 5}, "pk": 8, "model": "content.veggiesailorentry"}, {"fields": {"allows_smoking": null, "vg_object_id": 17140, "tags": [3, 4, 7, 8], "cuisines": [7], "rating": 0.0, "address2": "", "object_id": 9, "city": "", "zipcode": "", "summary": "", "modified": "2015-12-20T18:22:14.458Z", "description": "<p>Organic Raw Food Delivery in San Diego &amp; Orange County.</p>\n<p>Freshly made, gourmets raw foods and cleansing detoxing juices, smoothies, delivery to your door, every Wednesday</p>\n", "slug": "veggie-vibes-9", "created": "2015-12-20T18:22:02.930Z", "categories": [3, 6], "results_geo_place": "", "content_type": 8, "name": "Veggie Vibes", "allows_reservations": null, "payments": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], "price": 2, "address1": "", "region": 21, "rating_count": 0, "short_description": "Organic Raw Food Delivery in San Diego & Orange County", "level": 5}, "pk": 9, "model": "content.veggiesailorentry"}]
